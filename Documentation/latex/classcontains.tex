a class containing methods used to implement the algorithm in order to reach the goal and return back to home  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
a class containing methods used to implement the algorithm in order to reach the goal and return back to home 

, two of which are used to reach the goal i.\+e m\+\_\+left\+\_\+wall\+\_\+follower and m\+\_\+right\+\_\+wall\+\_\+follower methods and a third which is used to implement the return path. and also contains all the attributes needed to implement these three methods 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
